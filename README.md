# Emotion Detector

## Overview
The Emotion Detector is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify human emotions based on input data. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and/or computer vision techniques to analyze text or visual cues and determine the underlying emotional state. This project is useful for applications like sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

## Features
- **Emotion Recognition**: Classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and more.
- **Input Flexibility**: Supports text, audio, or image/video inputs (depending on implementation).
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides quick feedback for real-time applications.
- **Extensibility**: Easily adaptable to support additional emotions or integrate with other systems.

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Run the following command to analyze emotions from text input:
```bash
python main.py --input "Your input text here"
```

For image input:
```bash
python main.py --input /path/to/image.jpg
```

For video input:
```bash
python main.py --input /path/to/video.mp4
```

### Web Interface
1. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
